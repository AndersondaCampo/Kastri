# Web Browser Overlay Demo

## Description

Demonstrates using native controls that show over the top of `TWebBrowser`

Prompted by a question on Delphi Praxis, [here](https://en.delphipraxis.net/topic/12144-mouse-cursor/?do=findComment&comment=95938).

This demo has a single `TNativeImage` control with a mouse-pointer like image, which is overlaid on a `TWebBrowser`.

Please refer to the [native controls documentation](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Kastri/blob/master/Controls/NativeControls.md) for details about the controls themselves, **including installation**
