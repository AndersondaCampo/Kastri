# Connectivity Demo

This demo shows how you can check whether a device has an internet connection, and if such a connection is via Wifi

### Supported Delphi versions

The demo should compile and work for at least versions 10.3.3 and 10.4.x

### Supported Platforms

Currently supported platforms are Windows, iOS and Android

### Compiling for iOS

If compiling for iOS, you will need to add the SystemConfiguration framework to the iOS SDK. There are some instructions on [how to add a framework here](https://delphiworlds.com/2013/10/adding-other-ios-frameworks-to-the-sdk-manager) (needs updating, however it should still work)
