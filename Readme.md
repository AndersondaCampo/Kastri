## Kastri

* Is a cross-platform library which builds upon the existing RTL, FMX and VCL libraries in Delphi
* Supports a number of newer APIs that you won't find in FMX/RTL, and "backfills" for missing APIs
* Is structured in a way so as to avoid creating unnecessary dependencies
* Follows strict coding standards to ensure consistency and readability
* Is kept as simple as practicable
* Is named after the [place in Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kastri,_Phocis) where [Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi) once stood
