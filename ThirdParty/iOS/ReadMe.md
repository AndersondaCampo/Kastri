# iOS Frameworks

This folder contains frameworks that may not have imported correctly when using a newer version of Xcode, e.g. if iOS 13.5 SDK had been imported with an earlier version of Delphi (e.g. 10.3.x) and Xcode (e.g. 11.x).

The folders can be copied into your existing iOS SDK folder, e.g. C:\Users\(username)\Documents\Embarcadero\Studio\SDKs\iPhoneOS13.5.sdk
